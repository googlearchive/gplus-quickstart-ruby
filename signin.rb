# The Google+ Ruby Quickstart lets you get started with the Google+ platform
# in a few minutes.
#
# The app demonstrates:
#  * Using the Google+ Sign-In button to get an OAuth 2.0 refresh token.
#  * Exchanging the refresh token for an access token.
#  * Making Google+ API requests with the access token, including getting a
#    list of people that the user has circled.
#  * Disconnecting the app from the user's Google account and revoking tokens.
